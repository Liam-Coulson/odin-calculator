TOP foundations calculator project

I originally tried to solve this task by implementing a calculator that followed BIDMAS/PEMDAS rules, however this was too challenging and was making me put off work on the project so I decided to switch to a calculator that calculates inputs from left to right as specified in the project.

At this point in the project, I have met the following specifications/criteria for the project:

* Add, subtract, multiply and divide are all available and functional
* Clear and Delete keys are both present and working on the calculator
* The order of operations is left to right
* CSS of the website is not fully complete but is (in my opinion) decent

Additionally,

* Decimal inputs are valid
* It is possible to use the number and operation keys on your keyboard to input
* There is a backspace/delete key to undo an incorrect input

I am going to leave the project as it is for now, as all I will have to do if/when I return to it is to update the CSS and make the styling prettier. This is not as important to me right now as the CSS currently looks good in my opinion and I have spent a long time on the JavaScript for the calculator already and want to move ahead through the rest of TOP.
